# Can Used Cars Data Set Predict Political Elections?

As a final project for the Data Mining course at the IT University of Copenhagen, we explored whether a used cars data set could be used to predict which political party would win an election. Our main goal was to identify the optimal timing for buying or selling a used car, but we wanted to add a fun and interesting twist to the assignment by examining the intersection between democracy and morality with a used car database.

Although we did not expect to find any conclusive results, we were intrigued by the logic and implications of this task. We documented our findings and insights in the paper, including the interesting conclusions we drew about the best timing for buying or selling a used car.

In Section III of the paper, we delve into our political prediction experiment. We noted that purchasing a car is a reflection of one's values and beliefs, and we wondered if this could also apply to voting in elections. Specifically, we examined the used cars listed for a particular state to determine if there was a correlation between the type of car and the political party that won the election.
