# used_cars_for_political_prediction
Based on a used cars data set, is it possible to predict which political party is going to win the elections?

This political prediction based on a used cars data set was a part of my final assigment for the Data Mining subject at IT University in Copenhagen.

The main project aimed to predict the best moment ot buy or sell a used car, which drove interesting conclusions that you can read on the assigment's paper. 

The political prediction came as a fun and interesting add-on to the assigment, where morality and democracy where tied to a used cars data base. We knew in advance that we were not going to have any conclusive results, but the implications and the logic work around this task was interesting enough to try.


This is the intro to seccion III in the paper.

POLITICAL PREDICTION FROM CAR MARKET.
To buy a car represents in many ways a standpoint in
oneâ€™s beliefs; electric or gasoline, family size, big or compact,
luxurious or cost-efficient, comfort or performance? These
parameters represent an ethical perspective; some of the same
perspectives we think about when we vote in democracy. So
as a group we wondered: based on the used cars listed for a
specific state, is it possible to predict which political party
is going to win the elections?
